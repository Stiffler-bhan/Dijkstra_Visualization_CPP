Welcome to Dijkstra Visualizer! I built this application because I was fascinated the way Dijkstra works, and just wanted to visulize this in C++
using the old school graphics library. 
I have tried to bring the theoretical concept into a visualization application, and has shown the basic idea behind the Dijkstra Algorithm.

Dijkstra's Algorithm (weighted): the father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

<h3>Then you can add the obstacles in the graph if you want, then the algo would get you the best way possible jumoing the obstacles.

<h3> After that Dijkstra Algorithm starts it's work, of relaxing adjacent nodes one after the other.

<h3> In the Final Step it determine the shortest path reaching here both the examples mentioned below with and without the obstacles.
